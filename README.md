# quiz
A small mathematical quiz that reads from the problems.csv file. The user types their answer and presses enter.

Usage 
go run main.go -csv="different_file.csv" -limit=10

The -csv flag can be used to specify a different file, though it must be csv. 
The -limit flag allows the user to set a different length for the timer.
